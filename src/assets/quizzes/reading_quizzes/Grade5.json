		"passage": "Waiting By SF She told me to wait there. Whenever she told me to wait, I never moved. I sat there while the wind slipped inside my jacket and cut through the two shirts I always wore - just in case. Just in case she told me to sit on the park bench again. I pulled out my toy car that Granny gave me before she died - before I started waiting on the park bench. My car was a nice black, respected Mercedes Benz, Granny would say. I would grow up and go to a nice, respectable college, get a nice, respectable job, and marry a nice respectable woman. At seven years old, I just wanted to watch cartoons, but Granny would tell me stories that wouldn’t put me to sleep but make me daydream. Granny wasn’t just an old Regular grandma; she was a smart cookie. I didn’t know what a smart cookie was at seven years old, but she said she would show me better than she could explain. That’s when my Granny started to educate me.  She would show me fun ways of doing my work and explain it in a way that made  Everything else easy. She showed me how to respect my past and use it to be successful in my future. Now I sit here waiting for the person called my mom to come out of the smoky building so  I  can help her be a smart cookie like me.",
